# README

This is a repository for my final project where a trivia game has been created.

## Markdown

This README file supports Markdown syntax and so I can create
section headers using the '#' symbol followed by a title, on its own line.

## Contents

This repository should contain the following folders/files:
- trivia_game.py
- true_or_false.csv
- multiple_choice.csv
The `trivia_game.py` file contains the code to produce questions and compare answers
The `true_or_false.csv` file contains all the true or false questions.
The `multiple_choice.csv` file contains all the multiple choice questions.
